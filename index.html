                Ruphy Studio &trade; is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) platform for Ruby on Rails projects with a 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Delphi_(software)" target="_blank">Delphi</a> experience flavor in mind. 
                This is simply my love letter for myself (my 20-years-ago self).

            <h2>Main Goal</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <h3><em>That's the goal: to keep the wheel running from a new perspective, not reinventing it.</em></h3>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The idea is to allow Ruby on Rails projects to be created from scratch (and attach them to remote Git repositories) and provide a 
                new Drag and Drop experience to build WYSIWYG views using 
                <a href="https://github.com/ruby-ui/ruby_ui" target="_blank">Ruby UI</a> 
                <a href="https://rubyui.com/docs/introduction" target="_blank">components</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users will also check their work using the Live Preview feature to later on deploy it to a remote server using 
                <a href="https://kamal-deploy.org" target="_blank">Kamal</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll leverage experience with 
                <a href="https://hotwired.dev" target="_blank">Hotwire</a> to boost the UX with innovative and impactful approaches for developers 
                (or just my) happiness.
